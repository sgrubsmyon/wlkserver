# wlkserver

This repository contains the server backend with the HTTP-based API to interact with the SQL database.

This is meant as being part of a new, more modern, more modular server/client architecture of the fair trade shop point-of-sale system [Weltladenkasse](https://github.com/sgrubsmyon/Weltladenkasse).

The API is written in PHP and is based on this REST API PHP tutorial:
